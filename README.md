# Waypoint

Waypoint is a cross-platform Xamarin app which allows a user to take a picture of a physical map
and place a "You are here" dot on top of it. This is done by using OCR to read some metadata which
must be printed on the map, then using the device's geolocation with a little math it is able to
approximate the user's location on the map and place a visible dot there.

This was done for a Mobile App Design class at Santa Clara University.
